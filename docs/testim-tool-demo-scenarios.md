## 5. Demo Scenarios

This section demonstrates Testim's capabilities through two comprehensive automation testing scenarios that showcase AI-powered test creation, self-healing locators, data-driven testing, and advanced analytics features.

### 5.1 Scenario 1: Product Search & Filtering Automation

The Product Search & Filtering scenario validates the complete product discovery workflow for an e-commerce application, demonstrating Testim's AI-powered test creation and smart locator capabilities.

#### 5.1.1 Test Scope & Coverage

The product search and filtering test suite encompasses:

- **Search Functionality**: Text-based product search with auto-complete suggestions
- **Category Filtering**: Multi-level category navigation and filtering
- **Brand Filtering**: Multiple brand selection with real-time result updates
- **Price Range Filtering**: Slider-based price range selection with boundary testing
- **Sorting Options**: Multiple sort criteria (name, price, popularity, ratings)
- **Pagination**: Navigation through multiple result pages
- **Result Validation**: Product count accuracy and result relevance verification
- **Performance Testing**: Search response time and filter application speed

#### 5.1.2 AI-Powered Test Creation

**Natural Language Test Generation**:
Using Testim's AI capabilities, create tests by describing scenarios in plain English:

- "Navigate to products page and search for 'hammer' tools"
- "Filter results by 'Hand Tools' category and 'Stanley' brand"
- "Sort products by price from low to high and verify order"
- "Apply price filter between $10 and $50 and validate results"

**Smart Locator Application**:
Testim's AI automatically identifies the most reliable locators for key elements:

- Search input field: Combines `[data-test="search-query"]`, placeholder text, and visual position
- Category filters: Uses hierarchical structure, text content, and visual grouping
- Brand checkboxes: Identifies by label association, checkbox state, and DOM position
- Sort dropdown: Recognizes by option values, visual appearance, and interaction patterns

#### 5.1.3 Key Test Scenarios

**Basic Search Functionality**:

```
1. Navigate to product overview page
2. Enter "drill" in search field
3. Click search button
4. Verify results contain "drill" keyword
5. Validate result count is greater than 0
6. Check product titles highlight search term
```

**Advanced Filtering Workflow**:

```
1. Start with empty product page
2. Select "Power Tools" category
3. Apply "DeWalt" and "Makita" brand filters
4. Set price range $50-$200
5. Sort by "Price (Low to High)"
6. Verify all results match filters
7. Validate sort order is correct
8. Check filter persistence across pages
```

**Edge Case Testing**:

```
1. Search for non-existent product "xyz123"
2. Verify "no results" message displays
3. Apply conflicting filters (high-end brand + low price)
4. Test boundary values for price filter
5. Validate filter reset functionality
6. Test special characters in search
```

#### 5.1.4 Self-Healing Capabilities
